PYTHON:

programming language:
programming language is a set of rules that provides a way of telling a computer what operations to perform.
scripting language:
scripting language is a programming language that supports scripts, 
programs written for a special run-time environment that can interpret (rather than compile) 
and automate the execution of tasks that could alternatively be executed one-by-one by a human operator.


2 types of programming / script languages:

1) statically typed language:

    when we declare a variable in statically typed language, we to specify the type of the variable.
    int a =10;

    c, c++, java, c#, go, swift, rust, kotlin, typescript, etc.

2) dynamically typed language:
    when we declare a variable in dynamically typed language,
     we don't need to specify the type of the variable.

     javascript, python, ruby, php, etc.


variable declaration :

variable are the containers that are used to store the data.
1)int
float
double
boolean
long
char
string


to provide single line comment in python we use # symbol.

2 type of type casting:
1)narrowing type casting

    big data type to small data type  flaot --> int
2)widening type casting
    int --> float


when you are doing explicit type casting, only allows widening type casting.
