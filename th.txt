PYTHON:

programming language:
programming language is a set of rules that provides a way of telling a computer what operations to perform.
scripting language:
scripting language is a programming language that supports scripts, 
programs written for a special run-time environment that can interpret (rather than compile) 
and automate the execution of tasks that could alternatively be executed one-by-one by a human operator.


2 types of programming / script languages:

1) statically typed language:

    when we declare a variable in statically typed language, we to specify the type of the variable.
    int a =10;

    c, c++, java, c#, go, swift, rust, kotlin, typescript, etc.

2) dynamically typed language:
    when we declare a variable in dynamically typed language,
     we don't need to specify the type of the variable.

     javascript, python, ruby, php, etc.


variable declaration :

variable are the containers that are used to store the data.
1)int
float
double
boolean
long
char
string


to provide single line comment in python we use # symbol.

2 type of type casting:
1)narrowing type casting

    big data type to small data type  flaot --> int
2)widening type casting
    int --> float


when you are doing explicit type casting, only allows widening type casting.


operators: operators are the symbols that are used to perform the operations on the operands.
type of operators:
1)binary operators: binary operators require 2 operands.
2)uneary operators: python doesn't support uneary operators. 
it requires only 1 operands
3)ternary operators:    ? :

1)arithmetic operators:
    +, -, *, /, %, 
    // floor division
    ** exponentiation
2)assignment operators:
    =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, //=, **=
3)comparison operators:
    ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
4)logical operators:
    and, or, not
5)bitwise operators:
    &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>
    
6)identity operators:
    is, is not

7)membership operators:
    in, not in


decision making statements:
1)if statements
2)switch case statements  [not available in python]
3)loops

indentation:
    indentation is the space between the margin and the code.
    indentation is used to define the block of code.
    indentation is used to improve the readability of the code.
    indentation is used to define the scope of the code.

    in python, we use 4 spaces to define the indentation.
    in python, we can use tab key to define the indentation.


if condition{
    block
}
    

if condition:
    indentation block
    .

else:
    indentation block

    .    
loops:
entry controlled loop:
    while loop
    for loop
exit controlled loop:
    do while loop [not available in python]


for(int i=1;i<=5;i++){

}
int i=1;i<=5;i++  #range(1,6)

membership operators:
    in, not in
