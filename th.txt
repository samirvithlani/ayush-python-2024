PYTHON:

programming language:
programming language is a set of rules that provides a way of telling a computer what operations to perform.
scripting language:
scripting language is a programming language that supports scripts, 
programs written for a special run-time environment that can interpret (rather than compile) 
and automate the execution of tasks that could alternatively be executed one-by-one by a human operator.


2 types of programming / script languages:

1) statically typed language:

    when we declare a variable in statically typed language, we to specify the type of the variable.
    int a =10;

    c, c++, java, c#, go, swift, rust, kotlin, typescript, etc.

2) dynamically typed language:
    when we declare a variable in dynamically typed language,
     we don't need to specify the type of the variable.

     javascript, python, ruby, php, etc.


variable declaration :

variable are the containers that are used to store the data.
1)int
float
double
boolean
long
char
string


to provide single line comment in python we use # symbol.

2 type of type casting:
1)narrowing type casting

    big data type to small data type  flaot --> int
2)widening type casting
    int --> float


when you are doing explicit type casting, only allows widening type casting.


operators: operators are the symbols that are used to perform the operations on the operands.
type of operators:
1)binary operators: binary operators require 2 operands.
2)uneary operators: python doesn't support uneary operators. 
it requires only 1 operands
3)ternary operators:    ? :

1)arithmetic operators:
    +, -, *, /, %, 
    // floor division
    ** exponentiation
2)assignment operators:
    =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, //=, **=
3)comparison operators:
    ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
4)logical operators:
    and, or, not
5)bitwise operators:
    &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>
    
6)identity operators:
    is, is not

7)membership operators:
    in, not in
